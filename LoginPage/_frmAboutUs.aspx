                Since the start of our rental system we’ve been working on this network with 
                growing success. It started with only 20 bikes in Mysuru. Now, we work on
                an state basis with 300 bikes. 
                No other public bike sharing system can provide a larger network
                of rental bikes. This Bike Sharing System is present in more than 10 
                stations.
                Bike Sharing System - the name says it all: always having 
                a bike close by. Our bicycle fleet stands for urban mobility that is 
                inexpensive, flexible and healthy.</td>
